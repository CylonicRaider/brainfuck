# brainfuck

How long does it take to write a Brainfuck interpreter? A flash coding exercise.

I'm afraid I did underestimate the effort, and it was not twenty, but rather thirty minutes (if one includes source
control bookkeeping, and debugging, but still does not count creating proper test harnesses ;).

## History

**v1.0** was written on 2017-Jan-23, 18:33 to 19:03 UTC.

**v2.0** was written in the following half an hour after feed-back from @Garmelon (more exactly,
[his implementation](https://gist.github.com/Garmelon/6bbbd68461d480e46e3b8ae446220ed0)).
